Test for readiness by pressing lightly on top of the middle of the cake. it will be firm to the touch if ready, or you can insert a skewer or knife into the cake, if it comes out clean the cake is cooked.

If you're making the cake some weeks before you're going to eat it it's OK to freeze. A few days before you're gong to eat it put a few holes in the base of the cake and add a few drops of brandy.
